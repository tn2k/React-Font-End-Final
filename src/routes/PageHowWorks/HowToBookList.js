As an additional step, we provide you with a 48-hour guarantee from the time of move-in to signal to us if there is anything wrong with the property. If you feel that the property is significantly different from how it was presented in the listing, then we can help you. Here's what to do:
1) Contact the homeowner. Indicate what the problem is. In most cases, landlords will work quickly to resolve any problem.
2) If the landlord does not respond, or if you cannot come to an agreement with them, contact us within 48 hours of your move and tell us what the problem is. This is important, since we normally transfer the rent payment to the landlord 48 hours after your move-in date, if we do not hear from you. Please provide us with visual evidence, such as a photo or video, that shows us what is wrong with the property.`
